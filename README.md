# E-commerce-Website-by-Java-Spring-Boot
A person named Nahid wants to sell his products online. So he decided to create his own e-commerce website. But creating a full e-commerce is expensive. So he decided to have limited features. He wants to sell 3 types of product, RAM, MOTHERBOARD and GRAPHICS CARD. He wants to show the products with their prices, add a new product, update the details of the products, and delete them. He also wants some analytics: 1) Which product is profitable for his business (top 5) 2) Total number of products sold. Now you have to create an application with these limited features. To build this application you need to use the following technologies: Backend: Spring-Boot Build Tool: Maven Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL Frontend: use any technology you are comfortable with. So you need to create 6 pages to serve the purpose: 1) Give user a Dashboard to show statistics 2) Give user a window to add products. 3) Show all products with a delete button next to each item. 4) Give a window to update product’s information 5) Login page 6) About page which will be accessible by everyone. (accessible feature should be configured in Spring security ) **page designing is not a big cencern. You can use any frontend template or basic bootstrap template. Following requirements must be completed: Each product must have these four properties: Name, price, profit percentage, product type. By using profit percentage you can calculate the most profitable product. Paginate all the products. Frontend data validation is good. But server side data validation is must. Make sure no invalid data can enter the database. For this use JPA validation. Don’t use your own custom methods. You must design the codebase in such a way that it can be integrated with web services very easily. HINT: Interface for Services, DTO, Mapper.
